Sometimes we look for some data and we dont remember where they are, conversely sometimes we are not sure what this folder contains.

I'll try to maintain a description of the directory that are useful to us on proj64
Unless specified otherwise everything is under :
/gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/project/proj64/



*** home/bolanos/2019-10-02_bluelight_test
Contains Sirios preliminary simulation done begining of october

*** /gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/project/proj64/home/reimann/S1.v6_group_con_mats/group_con_mats.h5
Contains matrix that Michael extracted of column like division of a previous version of S1.v6
