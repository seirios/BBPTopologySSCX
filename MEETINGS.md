# 2019-10-29

+ Attending: Henri, Jānis, Jason, Nicolas, Sirio

+ Whole somatosensory cortex
	+ Not completely ready, will be 3 versions when done. 
	+ Structural data is accessable in Project 64 folder (subfolder called "circuits").
	+ Nicolas can extract structural data, so no need for Sirio to process it for rest of group.

+ Stimuli
	+ Unclear what they should be. Would like neurological / biological basis.
	+ One option is to do the same ones as for the Frontiers paper. 
	+ Sirio suggests stimuli could be placed in single column of same size as Frontiers, or in several columns, each of same size as Frontiers.
	+ In this bigger situation, should watch for waves / propogation. Unclear if they will appear if restrict to cylinder / small subset of SSCx. They have appeared in some anomalous test cases.

+ Size and locations of subsets of SSCx for experiments
	+ Jason suggests three sizes:
		+ First is same size as Frontiers (around 30 000 neurons)
		+ Second is slightly larger, but not whole thing
		+ Third is whole SSCx (around 1.7 million neurons)
	+ Sirio suggests borders should be avoided because of voxel issues
	+ Notion of a "middle column" needs to be defined. Sirio suggests keeping a distance of one microcolumn away from border when taking subsets.

+ Next meeting on November 6
	+ Nicolas will start writing specific plan on github repo. Jānis will contribute as well.
	+ Henry may have other ideas at meeting, so we shouldn't get too attached to any particular ideas.


# 2019-10-17

+ Attending: Henri, Kathryn, Jānis, Jason, Nicolas, Ran, Sirio

+ Redoing structural analysis of Frontiers paper
	+ Size of circuit will make some analysis impossible

+ Proposing new experiments
	+ What happens to the topology as the calcium concentration changes?
