# Work assignment

[jlazovskis] This document contains information about who will do which jobs / run which experiments. Also information on what to do differently.

## Redoing Frontiers experiments

[jlazovskis] This is about redoing the Frontiers analysis on a larger circuit, either the whole somatosensory cortex, or a cylinder of it.

+ [Figure 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/266051/fncom-11-00048-HTML-r3/image_m/fncom-11-00048-g003.jpg)
    + A1 - A3 will be different, as now L2 and L3 are separate. 

+ [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/266051/fncom-11-00048-HTML-r3/image_m/fncom-11-00048-g004.jpg)
    + E is very interesting

+ [Figure 5](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/266051/fncom-11-00048-HTML-r3/image_m/fncom-11-00048-g005.jpg)

    + Something like C would be great

+ Figure S5
    + Similar to Figure 6E, but in more detail

+ Figure S8


## New experiments

+ [JasonPSmith] For each neuron G we can compute the number of simplices for which G is a sink/source,
  we can then look at the distribution of sink/source neurons by type.
