**Zoom link**:


## Data available/extracted
Things that are needed for the different analysis we want to do

+ circuits
+ Simplices 
+ Correlations
+ TR 
+ frontiers simulation

## Analysis

### simulations
Sirio first results.

### Simplices 
Composition, locations

### Correlations
[Nicolas] what is the "formula" ie if we have the spike times for neuron A and B, how do we compute Cor(A,B).

### Transmission responses
[Nicolas] Do we have some working tested code (tested on previous sim where we know Michael TR)


### Other
