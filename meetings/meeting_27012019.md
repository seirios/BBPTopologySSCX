## Data available/extracted
Things that are needed for the different analysis we want to do

+ Circuits
+ Simplices 
+ Simulations 
+ Correlations
+ TR   
+ Frontier's simulation


## Analysis

### simulations
Sirio first results (since last meeting in december). On bioM (ca scan ?,flick?, other)

### Simplices 
counts,composition, locations, counts with respect to different subpar, basically every thing in frontiers
or more.

### Correlations
[Nicolas] what is the "formula" ie if we have the spike times for neuron A and B, how do we compute Cor(A,B).

### Transmission responses
[Nicolas] Do we have some working tested code (tested on previous sim where we know Michael TR)


### Other
