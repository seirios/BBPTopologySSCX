## Data available/extracted
Things that are needed for the different analysis we want to do

+ Circuits
+ Simplices 
+ Simulations 
+ Correlations
+ TR   
+ Frontier's simulation


## Analysis

### simulations
Sirio first results (since last meeting in december). On bioM (ca scan ?,flick?, other)

### Simplices 
counts,composition, locations, counts with respect to different subpar, basically every thing in frontiers
or more.

### Correlations
[Nicolas] what is the "formula" ie if we have the spike times for neuron A and B, how do we compute Cor(A,B).  
Answer: in frontiers 4.8.: They did 30 trials of 5s for each stimulus.Then they bin the spike time in bin of 25ms
(also tried 10ms 50 100 250 500). Then they do pearson Correlation (ie normalized covariance).

### Transmission responses
[Nicolas] Do we have some working tested code (tested on previous sim where we know Michael TR)
