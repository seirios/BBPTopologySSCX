This folder contains some plots about the structure of the cliques by neuron type, the current images are:

Neuron_as_sink: For each neuron the number of directed cliques with that neuron as the sink

Neuron_as_source: For each neuron the number of directed cliques with that neuron as the source

Sink_type: For each neuron type the number of directed cliques with that neuron type as the sink

Source_type: For each neuron type the number of directed cliques with that neuron type as the source

Sink_type_dim: The same as Sink_type, but broken down by dimension

Source_type_dim: The same as Source_type, but broken down by dimension

Source_and_sink_heatmap: A heatmap of the number of cliques with a given neuron type as the source and given neuron type as the sink

Source_and_sink_heatmap_dim: The same as Source_and_sink_heatmap, but broken down by dimension
