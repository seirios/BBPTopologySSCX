This folder contains some plots and data about the structure of the cliques by neuron type in Bio1, the current files are:

Neuron_as_sink: For each neuron the number of directed cliques with that neuron as the sink

Neuron_as_source: For each neuron the number of directed cliques with that neuron as the source

Sink_type: For each neuron type the number of directed cliques with that neuron type as the sink

Source_type: For each neuron type the number of directed cliques with that neuron type as the source

Sink_type_dim: The same as Sink_type, but broken down by dimension

Source_type_dim: The same as Source_type, but broken down by dimension

Source_and_sink_heatmap: A heatmap of the number of cliques with a given neuron type as the source and given neuron type as the sink

Source_and_sink_heatmap_dim: The same as Source_and_sink_heatmap, but broken down by dimension

top_simplex_types.txt: For each dimension the 50 most numerous simplex types are listed, where a simplex type is a list of all the neuron types in the simplex, and next to each simplex type is the number of times that simplex type appears

types.txt: The number of neurons of each neuron type.
