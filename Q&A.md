# Q&A

+ [seirios] What files do you work with when analyzing connectivity? (e.g. synapse files, target files, etc.)

    ANSWER HERE PLEASE

+ [seirios] When you count simplices, can you also list them (i.e. list what GIDs are members of each simplex and their positions therein)? I'm thinking it may be interesting to stimulate specific (groups of) simplices and see what happens, specially if we consider their layer-specific directionality.

    [jlazovskis] Partial answer: Aberdeen group is also working on understanding which "communities" (neuron with high clustering coefficient and all its neighbors) rather than simplices are interesting. GIDs of neurons in top 15 communities are in <code>home/lazovski/visualizing-neuron-communities/gid_position_voltage_spikes/n_gid</code> for <code>n</code> in <code>00,...,14</code>.
