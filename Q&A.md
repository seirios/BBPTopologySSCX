    ANSWER HERE PLEASE

+ [seirios] When you count simplices, can you also list them (i.e. list what GIDs are members of each simplex and their positions therein)? I'm thinking it may be interesting to stimulate specific (groups of) simplices and see what happens, specially if we consider their layer-specific directionality.

    ANSWER HERE PLEASE
